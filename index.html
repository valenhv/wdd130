        <p>Hello! I'm a BYU Idaho student who's from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I enjoy learning coding! I also have other hobbies, such as listening to music, drawing, painting, and just art in general (I love creating things!). Ever since I was very little I was into the many forms of art (but mainly drawing), so I think I can call myself an artist, too!<br>Besides that, I also really like languages, I find them fascinating! I am currently learning C1 English, and for school I had to learn a bit of Portuguese too. This year, I'm planning to learn both German and Japanese! And one day, I'll speak multiple languages!<br>Technology is another interest of mine- particularly, design languages, with Aero and Aqua being my favourites.<br>One day, I hope to be a front-end developer and assist my dad with his projects (he's a programmer!) and also make mine a reality too! It's one of the reasons why I'm learning at BYU-Idaho.</p>
